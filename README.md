# Welcome
This is an example repository that was made to support my blog article. You can read it [here](https://dev.to/rocksheep/how-to-use-psr-http-standards-to-upgrade-your-code-3l92).

It's about how to use the PSR HTTP standard and how they can help you write better code! 

Feel free to look around the repo and check out the examples to see how this works.
